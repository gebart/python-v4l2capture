Introduction
============

libvideolive is a slim and easy to use Python extension for
capturing and streaming video. 

this fork of python-v4l2capture: https://github.com/gebart/python-v4l2capture

Installation on Linux
=====================

libvideolive on linux requires libv4l by default. You can do so by erasing ', libraries = ["v4l2"]'
in setup.py and erasing '#define USE_LIBV4L' in v4l2capture.cpp.

libvideolive uses distutils to compile. For Linux:

./setup.py build
sudo ./setup.py install

Installation on Windows
=====================

Modify setup.py to specify locations of libjpeg and pthread external libraries.

With Visual Studio 2010:

SET VS90COMNTOOLS=%VS100COMNTOOLS%
python setup.py build -c msvc
python setup.py install

Remember to put the libjpeg and pthread dlls somewhere appropriate.
